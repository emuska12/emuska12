# 💫 About Me:
Hello World! 👋  I'm Ema, an ambitious student  of Faculty of Informatics and Information Technologies STU 👩‍🎓 based in Slovakia. <br><br>I thrive on turning ideas 💡 into reality through code and creative problem solving. I'm keen on interactive art and experimenting. 💥<br><br>As a student, I try to learn as much as I can. 📚 I love the challenge 📈 and learning.<br><br>🌐 My journey in tech has began 3 years ago, and since then, I've had the opportunity to build a couple of projects. From RC car that was able to solve the maze 🚗 to my own audio visualizer 🎧, each experience has added a unique layer to my skill set on a mission to make software that not only works but also puts a smile on users' faces.<br><br>I'm fluent in Python, C, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and I'm always excited to explore new tools 🛠️  and frameworks and broaden my experiences. <br><br>When I'm not coding, you can find me hanging from the boulder wall 🧗‍♀️ or playing the guitar 🎸. I believe in maintaining healthy work/life balance. 🏄‍♀️<br><br>🤝 I'm a firm believer in the power of collaboration and open communication. Let's connect, share ideas, and build something amazing together! Feel free to explore my repositories and don't hesitate to reach out. I'm always up for a good chat or collaboration opportunity.
